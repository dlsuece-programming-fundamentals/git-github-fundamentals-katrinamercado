## 📝 What I learned

* Hello! In this course, I learned how to create a repository, edit my personal README.md file, and create a pull request. Aside from this, I learned the convenience of github as it allows for easy collaboration between peers. It is still unclear how to create new files (such as markdown files) and add them to other repositories.
